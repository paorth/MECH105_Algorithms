# MECH105_Algorithms
These are the MATLAB algorithms I wrote in my MECH105 engineering class at Colorado State University during my freshman year.

The purpose of creating these algorithms was to add on to becoming more comfortable with engineering analysis and problem solving as well as learning how to approach and solve various types of mechanical engineering analysis and design problems (and, in so doing, learn about various areas of mechanical engineering). 

Overall, these algorithms were an excellent and effiecent way to learn more about engineering techniques used in the current engineering field.
